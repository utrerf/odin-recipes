    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; 
            gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. 
            Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy!
